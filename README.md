## Overview

Bees & Bears is a digital lending platform API designed for solar panel installers to create and manage customer loan offers. The system features role-based access control (RBAC) with two distinct user roles: **Installers** (who create and manage customer records and loan offers) and **Customers** (who can view their own loan information). The platform handles customer information, loan calculations using standard amortization formulas, and provides JWT-based authentication with granular permissions.

## Technology Stack

### Core Framework
- **Python 3.12**: Stable Python version
- **Django 5.2.7**: Modern web framework with excellent ORM
- **Django REST Framework 3.16.1**: Powerful toolkit for building Web APIs

### Database
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Production-grade relational database
  - **Why PostgreSQL?**
    - ACID compliance for financial data integrity
    - Excellent support for concurrent connections
    - Advanced indexing capabilities (B-tree, GiST, GIN)
    - JSON support for future extensibility
    - Connection pooling via `CONN_MAX_AGE`
    - Strong data integrity constraints
    - Battle-tested for financial applications

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`
  - Access tokens (1-hour expiry)
  - Refresh tokens (7-day expiry with rotation)
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Two-tier permission system
  - INSTALLER role: Full access to create/view all resources
  - CUSTOMER role: Read-only access to own linked records

### Application Server
- **Gunicorn with Sync Workers**: Simple and reliable process-based concurrency
  - Sync worker class for straightforward request handling
  - Dynamic worker scaling: (CPU cores × 2) + 1
  - Worker recycling with max 1000 requests per worker
  - 120-second timeout for long-running requests

### Development Tools
- **Poetry**: Dependency management and virtual environments
- **pytest**: Testing framework with comprehensive coverage
- **factory_boy**: Test data generation
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **Flake8**: Linting
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

### Containerization
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Container orchestration
- **Multi-stage builds**: Optimized image size

### API Documentation
- **drf-spectacular**: OpenAPI 3.0 schema generation
- **Swagger UI**: Interactive API documentation
- **ReDoc**: Alternative API documentation

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Scalability

1**Database Connection Pooling**
   - `CONN_MAX_AGE=60` keeps connections alive
   - Reduces connection overhead
   - Efficient resource utilization

2**Strategic Database Indexing**
   - Indexed fields: email, created_at, status, foreign keys
   - Composite indexes for common query patterns
   - B-tree indexes for range queries

3**Optimized Query Patterns**
   - `select_related()` for foreign key relationships
   - Pagination for large datasets (100 items per page)
   - Read-only serializers for list views

4**Stateless Authentication**
   - JWT tokens eliminate session storage
   - No server-side session state
   - Horizontal scaling without sticky sessions

### Security Best Practices

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for granular permissions
- Password validation with Django validators
- JWT token expiration and rotation
- CORS configuration
- SQL injection prevention via ORM
- Input validation at serializer level
- Environment-based configuration
- Object-level permissions for customer data isolation

## Design Assumptions & Constraints

### Business Rules
- **Customer Creation**: Only installers can create customer records (no self-registration for customers)
- **Multi-tenancy**: Not implemented. System operates as single-tenant (suitable for B2C model)
- **Company Concept**: No company/organization hierarchy. Installers operate independently
- **External Integrations**: No external bank APIs or credit scoring services (can be added later)

### Validation Constraints
- **Loan Amount**: €500 minimum, €1,000,000 maximum
- **Interest Rate**: 0% - 50% annual percentage rate
- **Loan Term**: 1 - 600 months (up to 50 years)
- **Email Uniqueness**: Enforced at database level for customers

### Caching Strategy
- **No caching layer implemented** (Redis/Memcached)
- **Justification**:
  - Data is highly transactional and changes frequently
  - Most queries are customer-specific (low cache hit rate)
  - PostgreSQL query performance is sufficient for current scale
  - Database connection pooling provides adequate performance
- **Future Consideration**: Add caching if read-heavy patterns emerge

### Static Files
- **WhiteNoise** middleware for static file serving
- Allows self-contained deployment without nginx/CDN dependency

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ User registration with password validation
- ✅ JWT-based login (access + refresh tokens)
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Secure password hashing
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - **INSTALLER Role**: Create customers & loan offers, view all data
  - **CUSTOMER Role**: View only own customer profile & loan offers
- ✅ Granular permission classes (IsInstaller, IsInstallerOrOwner)

### Customer Management
- ✅ Create customer records (INSTALLER only)
- ✅ Retrieve customer details
- ✅ Update customer information (PUT/PATCH)
- ✅ Delete customer records
- ✅ List customers with pagination
- ✅ Associate customers with installers
- ✅ Email uniqueness validation
- ✅ RBAC enforcement on all operations

### Loan Offers
- ✅ Create loan offers with automatic payment calculation (INSTALLER only)
- ✅ Retrieve loan offer details
- ✅ Update loan offers (PUT/PATCH)
- ✅ Delete loan offers
- ✅ List loan offers with pagination
- ✅ Standard amortization formula implementation
- ✅ Zero-interest loan support
- ✅ Comprehensive validation:
  - Loan amount: €500 - €1,000,000
  - Interest rate: 0% - 50%
  - Loan term: 1 - 600 months (50 years)

### Loan Calculation Formula

The monthly payment is calculated using the standard loan amortization formula:

```
M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:
M = Monthly payment
P = Principal (loan amount)
r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
n = Number of payments (loan term in months)

For zero interest: M = P / n
```

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Poetry 2.1.1
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized setup)
- PostgreSQL 16 (for local development without Docker)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bees-and-bears
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with Poetry**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate virtual environment**
   ```bash
   poetry env activate
   ```
    Run the above command to output the activation command you need to run.
    Copy and paste that command to activate the virtual environment.
4. **Copy environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **Generate a secure SECRET_KEY**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
   ```

   Edit `.env` with your configuration:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=True
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=bees_and_bears
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=postgres
   ```

   **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file or expose your `SECRET_KEY`. Use a different secret key for each environment (dev, staging, production).

5. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Create superuser for Django Admin**

   **Important**: The superuser is required to access the Django Admin interface at `/admin` where you can:
   - Create installer users (assign INSTALLER role)
   - Manage customers and loan offers
   - View all system data

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set username, email, and password.

### Docker Setup (Recommended for Production)

1. **Copy environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   **Generate a secure SECRET_KEY**:
   ```bash
   python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
   ```

   **Important**: Edit `.env` with secure credentials before starting Docker:
   ```env
   SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key-here
   DEBUG=False
   DJANGO_SUPERUSER_USERNAME=admin
   DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL=admin@example.com
   DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
   DB_PASSWORD=secure-database-password
   ```

   The superuser account is automatically created on first startup and is used to:
   - Access Django Admin interface at `/admin`
   - Create installer users with INSTALLER role
   - Manage all system resources

2. **Build and start containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

   On first startup, the system will:
   - Run database migrations
   - Create the default superuser automatically (using credentials from `.env`)
   - Start the application server

3. **Check container status**
   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. **View logs**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f app
   ```

## Running the Application

### Local Development

```bash
# Using Django development server (not recommended for production)
python manage.py runserver

# Using Gunicorn (production-like)
gunicorn config.wsgi:application -c gunicorn_config.py
```

### Docker

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Access Points

- **API Base URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/api/redoc/
- **OpenAPI Schema**: http://localhost:8000/api/schema/

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### User Roles

The system implements a two-tier role-based access control system:

#### 1. **INSTALLER Role**
Installers have full permissions to:
- ✅ Create customer records
- ✅ Create loan offers for any customer
- ✅ View all customers in the system
- ✅ View all loan offers in the system
- ✅ View detailed information about any customer or loan offer

**Use Case**: Solar panel installation companies use installer accounts to manage their customer portfolio and create financing offers.

#### 2. **CUSTOMER Role**
Customers have restricted, read-only permissions to:
- ✅ View their own linked customer profile only
- ✅ View loan offers associated with their profile only
- ❌ Cannot create customer records
- ❌ Cannot create loan offers
- ❌ Cannot view other customers' data

**Use Case**: End customers can log in to view their loan application status and details.

### Permission Classes

The system uses custom permission classes:

1. **`IsInstaller`**: Allows access only to users with INSTALLER role
   - Used for: Customer creation, Loan offer creation

2. **`IsInstallerOrOwner`**: Allows access to installers or resource owners
   - Used for: Customer detail view, Loan offer detail view
   - Installers can view any resource
   - Customers can only view their own linked resources

3. **`IsAuthenticated`**: Allows any authenticated user (with role-based filtering)
   - Used for: List views with automatic queryset filtering
   - Installers see all records
   - Customers see only their own records


## Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
# With coverage report
poetry run pytest

# Without coverage
poetry run pytest --no-cov

# Specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_authentication.py

# Specific test class
poetry run pytest tests/test_customers.py::TestCustomerCreate

# Specific test method
poetry run pytest tests/test_loan_offers.py::TestLoanCalculations::test_monthly_payment_calculation_standard

# Verbose output
poetry run pytest -v
```

### Test Structure

Tests follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern:

```python
def test_create_customer_success(self, authenticated_client, user):
    # Arrange (Setup)
    url = reverse("customers:customer-create")
    data = {...}

    # Act
    response = authenticated_client.post(url, data, format="json")

    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED
    assert response.data["email"] == "john.doe@example.com"
```

## Database Schema

### User Model (Custom)

```python
- id: BigAutoField (Primary Key)
- username: CharField(150, Unique)
- email: EmailField(Unique)
- password: CharField(128) [Hashed]
- role: CharField(20) [INSTALLER, CUSTOMER]
- is_active: BooleanField
- is_staff: BooleanField
- date_joined: DateTimeField
- last_login: DateTimeField

# Computed Properties:
- is_installer: Returns True if role == INSTALLER
- is_customer: Returns True if role == CUSTOMER
```

### Customer Model

```python
- id: BigAutoField (Primary Key)
- first_name: CharField(100)
- last_name: CharField(100)
- email: EmailField (Unique, Indexed)
- phone_number: CharField(20)
- address_line1: CharField(255)
- address_line2: CharField(255)
- city: CharField(100)
- state: CharField(100)
- postal_code: CharField(20)
- country: CharField(100)
- user: OneToOneField(User) [Optional - for customer portal access]
- created_by: ForeignKey(User) [The installer who created this record]
- created_at: DateTimeField (Indexed)
- updated_at: DateTimeField
```

### LoanOffer Model

```python
- id: BigAutoField (Primary Key)
- customer: ForeignKey(Customer, Indexed)
- loan_amount: DecimalField(12, 2)
- interest_rate: DecimalField(5, 2)
- loan_term: IntegerField
- monthly_payment: DecimalField(12, 2) [Calculated]
- status: CharField(20, Indexed)
- created_by: ForeignKey(User)
- created_at: DateTimeField (Indexed)
- updated_at: DateTimeField
```

### Indexes

The following indexes are created for optimal query performance:

#### Customer Model
- `email` (unique, B-tree)
- `created_at` (B-tree)
- `(created_by, created_at)` (composite)
- `(last_name, first_name)` (composite)

#### LoanOffer Model
- `customer` (foreign key, B-tree)
- `status` (B-tree)
- `created_at` (B-tree)
- `(customer, status)` (composite)
- `(status, created_at)` (composite)
- `(created_by, created_at)` (composite)

**Why these indexes?**
- **Email**: Frequent lookups for customer uniqueness validation and authentication
- **created_at**: Enables efficient time-based queries, sorting, and pagination
- **Status**: Common filtering pattern for loan offer management
- **Foreign Keys**: Automatically indexed for JOIN operations
- **Composite Indexes**: Optimize multi-column WHERE clauses and filtering patterns
- **Impact**: Reduces query time from O(n) to O(log n) for indexed lookups

## Performance Optimization

### Database Level
1. **Connection Pooling**: `CONN_MAX_AGE=60` reuses connections
2. **Indexes**: Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
3. **Query Optimization**: `select_related()` reduces N+1 queries

### Application Level
1. **Pagination**: Limits result sets to 100 items
2. **Serializer Optimization**: Lightweight list serializers
3. **Computed Fields**: Cached via @property decorators

## Design Justifications

### Why Django?

**Cost Efficiency & Developer Productivity**:
- Mature ORM with excellent PostgreSQL support
- Built-in admin interface for rapid management UI
- Extensive ecosystem and third-party packages
- Battle-tested in production environments
- Lower development and maintenance costs compared to microservices
- Monolithic architecture suitable for current scale

### Why Gunicorn with Sync Workers?

**Design Philosophy**: Simple, reliable, and appropriate for the current scale.

**Why Sync Workers**:
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward process-based concurrency model
- **Reliability**: Well-tested and predictable behavior
- **Debuggability**: Easier to troubleshoot and profile than async code
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Full compatibility with all Django libraries
- **No Complexity Overhead**: No need for async/await or greenlet management
- **Process Isolation**: Each worker is independent; crashes don't affect others
- **Sufficient Performance**: Handles current scale efficiently with database connection pooling

**When to Consider Alternatives**:
- **High Concurrency (>10,000 simultaneous requests)**: Consider Gevent/Eventlet for async I/O
- **WebSockets/Long-polling**: Would require ASGI (Uvicorn/Daphne)
- **Extreme Scale**: Move to async workers or microservices architecture

**Current Scale is Appropriate For**:
- Small to medium deployments (up to several thousand concurrent users)
- Typical B2B/B2C lending platform usage patterns
- Database-heavy operations with connection pooling
- Standard CRUD operations without long-running tasks

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Gevent/Eventlet**: Adds unnecessary complexity for current scale; async benefits not needed
- **Uvicorn/ASGI**: Requires rewriting with async/await; overkill for simple CRUD operations
- **Threading workers**: Higher memory overhead, GIL limitations, harder to debug

### Why PostgreSQL?

**Requirements**: Financial data, ACID compliance, high concurrency

**PostgreSQL Advantages**:
- Transaction integrity (critical for loan data)
- Row-level locking for concurrent updates
- Advanced indexing (GIN, GiST, partial indexes)
- JSON support for future feature extensions
- Proven track record in fintech
- Excellent connection pooling
- Strong community and tooling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MySQL: Weaker transaction guarantees
- MongoDB: Not suitable as more relations are added
